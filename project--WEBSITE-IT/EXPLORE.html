    <div class="box">
      <h1><u> <i>KEDARNATH TREK :</i></u></h1><br><br>

      <p> <font size="04">Located in the Western Garhwal region in the state of Uttarakhand, Kedarkantha Trek is one of the most popular winter treks going around. This is also one of the few treks where a less experienced trekker can get a winter trek experience in less than a week’s time. The trip commences from Dehradun, from where you drive to the small, but pretty village of Sankri. The village is inside Govind Wildlife Sanctuary, which is home to diverse species of flora and fauna. Hiking towards Juda Ka Talab – the highlight of the Kedarkantha trekking tour - come across Saud Village and witness the traditional way of life without modern technologies. Juda Ka Talab is a mesmerizing pond, surrounded by lush pastures, and forests of maple, oak and Morinda spruce trees.</font></p><br>

 

     <p><font size="04">Stay overnight in the camps that are set up close to the lake. This gives you enough time to relax, spend some quality time, and to prepare for the trip ahead. The next leg of the Kedarkantha trekking itinerary takes you to the base of the summit that is a velvety meadow. Hiking through oak and maple trees, immersed in the aroma of various species of flowers, is a treat for the senses. The meadow comes out as an incredible location to set up camps as you get to see awe-inspiring scenery. Spend the night in your camp, and if you are an early riser, then you might just experience an amazing sunrise.</font></p><br>

 

     <p><font size="04">After breakfast, head towards the Kedarkantha Peak, which has a Trishul fixed on a pile of rocks. Make the most of this trek to Kedarkantha by standing on the summit and looking far and wide into the sky or at the valleys below. After spending some time atop the mountain, start descending towards the campsite. On arrival here, relish lunch, and then begin the downhill walk to reach the Sankri village. The stroll will be quite an experience in itself as you will come across numerous small ponds and streams on the way. On arrival in Sankri, spend the night at a guesthouse, and in the morning drive back to Dehradun.</font></p><br><br>

<h1><u><i> RANTHAMBORE NATIONAL PARK - JUNGLE SAFARI :</i></u></h1><br><br>

<p> <font size="04"> Ranthambore National Park and Tiger Reserve is one of the world’s best known wilderness areas. Located 14 kilometres from Sawai Madhopur and at the junction of some of the geologically oldest mountain ranges - the Aravallis and Vindyas - Ranthambore offers some of the finest opportunities for sighting the magnificent tiger in the wild. A mix of rolling hills and crags, and meadows, lakes and rivulets, this dry-deciduous forest system is home to an incredible variety of flora and fauna. Apart from the tiger, you can also spot sloth bear, leopard, caracal, jackal, fox, hyena and mongoose at Ranthambore.</p><br>

<p>This region, with its relics, is a historically important reminder of the misty past. The fort of Ranthambore was the canter of a Hindu Kingdom which was invested by Allaudin Khilji's army in 1301 A.D. He later defeated its king, Raja Hamir, and the Rajput, women are reputed to have committed the terrible ritual of sali in the fort. However, the area soon slipped back into the hands of the Rajputs and again became a powerful kingdom. The Mughal Emperor, Akbar, invested it in 1569, the year after he took the fort at Chittor, and conquered it in 40 days of warfare</p><br>

<p>This park also has a large population of panthers which are the second largest predators of this forest. The prey species of tigers and panthers overlap, and because of possible conflicts between them, the latter are found more often on the periphery of the park. Kachida valley accounts for the highest number of sightings of these cats. They do not appear to be as fearlessly diurnal as tigers have become and therefore their sightings are not as frequent.</font></p><br><br>

  <h1><u><i> RIVER RAFTING IN RISHIKESH :</i></u></h1><br><br>

  <p><font size="04">Rishikesh may be popular for its sacred Hindu temples and Yoga centres across the globe, but river rafting is another aspect of it that is garnering quite a fame. River rafting in Rishikesh is an ultimate experience for adventure seekers, who simply love the thrill and adrenaline rush of riding waves.</p><br>

<p>If you are planning your first experience of rafting in Rishikesh, then be sure that this will not be the last; such is the charm of it. To make this experience even more memorable, staying at the beach camp at Byasi on the bank of the mighty Ganges can certainly be a great option. Once you reach the camp, just relax in the pleasant environs and enjoy the services of the camp staff. On the first day, spend quality time enjoying with your group at the beach or indulge in activities, such as beach volleyball, kayaking, rappelling or hiking. If you are interested to include Yoga or meditation sessions as part of your Rishikesh rafting package, then let the camp staff know about it in advance; they will be glad to make the arrangements.</p><br>

<p>The following day, gear up for your much-awaited rafting session, which will be conducted by trained professionals. These professionals will not only provide you with the requisite equipment but also give you a brief training before you embark on an exciting river rafting experience!</p><br>

<h2><u>Day 01: Arrival in Rishikesh | Leisure at Campsite</u></h2><br>
<p>As you enter Rishikesh, you will be greeted by the sounds of temple bells, aroma of incense and lush greenery. Proceed straight to the campsite while you continue admiring the sight of the pious Ganga River and hordes of devotees performing various rituals along its banks.</p><br>

<p>On reaching the camp, meet the camp organisers who would brief you about your itinerary and allot your beachside tents. Thereafter, unpack and relax before heading to the dining tent to enjoy your lunch. After savouring mouth-watering delicacies for lunch, spend the afternoon at leisure at the beach. Alternatively, you can play beach volleyball or have fun kayaking, rock climbing and rappelling.</p><br>

<p>Later, relish evening snacks at the camp, followed by a delicious dinner at the dining tent. Enjoy overnight stay at the camp.</p><br>

<h3><u>Day 02: River Rafting | Departure from Rishikesh</u></h3><br>
<p>Get up early in the morning and spend some quality time at the beach.</p><br>

<p>Thereafter, enjoy tea/coffee at the dining tent, followed by a drive to the spot from where the river rafting adventure would begin. Before the rafting session is initiated, you would be provided with the rafting gear including paddle, helmet and life jacket, and you would be given a safety briefing.</p><br>

<p>This rafting trip is 26 km long, during which, you would ride over rapids like Golf Course, Return to Sender, Roller Coaster, Body Surfing, Crossfire and Three Blind Mice. You will also get a chance to do cliff jumping and body-surfing during the course of this trip. Relish snacks and soft drinks along the way (liquor is prohibited on the rafting trip). This amazing, adrenaline-rushing rafting expedition will end near the famous Lakshman Jhula. Thereafter, proceed towards your onward destination bidding adieu to the mystic town of Rishikesh.</font></p><br>
